# Solar Sales Trainer Agent - Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Create an AI-powered sales training agent designed to fast-track the onboarding of solar sales consultants. The agent will provide interactive roleplay and educational content for Door-to-Door (D2D), Telescope/Phone, and Virtual (Video) sales channels.

## User Review Required
- [ ] Confirm specific solar industry terminology or scripts to use.
- [ ] Review the proposed tech stack (LLM choice, Voice API, etc.).
- [ ] Validate the interaction model (Text vs. Voice-first).

## Proposed Architecture & Tools

### Core Components
1.  **Orchestrator Agent**: Manages the training session state and curriculum progress.
2.  **Roleplay Engine**: Simulates customer personas (skeptical homeowner, busy professional, eco-enthusiast).
3.  **Evaluation Module**: Scores user performance based on tone, objection handling, and script adherence.
4.  **Content Knowledge Base**: Stores sales scripts, objection handlers, and product specs.

### Fast-Track Methodology
To ensure speed, the agent will use "Micro-Learning" and "Active Recall":
1.  **Skill Assessment**: Initial diagnostic roleplay to skip modules the rep already knows.
2.  **Interactive Drills**: 5-minute rapid-fire objection handling sessions (e.g., "Handle 10 'Too Expensive' objections in 2 minutes").
3.  **Just-in-Time Knowledge**: Contextual help that pops up only when the rep struggles, reducing reading time.

### White-Labeling & Multi-Tenancy Architecture
To sell this platform to different solar companies:
1.  **Tenant Isolation**: Each company (Tenant) has a unique ID, custom branding (Logo, Colors), and private content (Battle Cards, Custom Scripts).
2.  **Configuration Injection**: The app loads a `config.json` at startup:
    ```json
    {
      "company_name": "SunPower Elite",
      "primary_color": "#FFD700",
      "voice_tone": "Professional",
      "custom_script_overrides": ["path/to/script.md"]
    }
    ```

### State-Specific Knowledge Engine
The agent must dynamically adjust training based on the rep's jurisdiction.
1.  **Incentive Database**: A lookup table of state regulations.
    *   *California*: NEM 3.0 (Battery focus, export rates are low).
    *   *New York*: VDER / Net Metering 1:1 (depending on zone).
    *   *Texas*: Deregulated market, plan selection is key.
2.  **Context-Aware Scripting**:
    *   If `State == CA`, the agent changes the "Savings Pitch" to focus on *Self-Consumption* (Batteries).
    *   If `State == NY`, the agent changes the "Savings Pitch" to focus on *Grid Credits*.
3.  **Module 4: Regulatory Quiz**: A mandatory module for each state that tests specific knowledge (e.g., "What is the true-up period in your utility territory?").

### Recommended Tools
*   **LLM Backend**: Gemini 1.5 Pro or similar for long-context reasoning and roleplay.
*   **Voice/Audio**: ElevenLabs (for realistic customer voices) + Whisper (for speech-to-text) to allow actual voice practice.
*   **Frontend**: React/Next.js for a dashboard to track progress and launch training modules.
*   **Vector Database**: Pinecone or ChromaDB for retrieving specific sales objections and answers.
*   **Database (SQL)**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) to handle relational data (Tenants, Users, StateInstructions).

## Training Modules

### 1. Door-to-Door (D2D)
*   **Focus**: rapid rapport building, body language (via video analysis if capable, or descriptive prompts), canvassing scripts.
*   **Scenarios**: "Not interested" at the door, "Just waiting for spouse", "Solar is a scam".

### 2. Over the Phone
*   **Focus**: Tone modulation, script pacing, setting appointments.
*   **Scenarios**: Cold calling leads, confirming appointments, re-engaging old leads.

### 3. Virtual (Zoom/Video)
*   **Focus**: Screen sharing etiquette, walking through proposals, visual selling.
*   **Scenarios**: Full sales presentation, handling technical questions, closing the deal remotely.

## Suggestions for "Wow" Features
-   **Gamification**: Leaderboards for "fastest objection handling" or "highest closure rate" in sim.
-   **Real-time Feedback**: Live tips popping up during a practice call (e.g., "Slow down," "You missed the tax credit benefit").
-   **"Hell Week" Mode**: A high-intensity mode with difficult/angry customer personas to build resilience.
