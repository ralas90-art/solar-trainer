We Take Care of The Heavy Lifting
Our team will come to your home to obtain exact measurements and to make a study of the shadow generated around your house.
Then, we will confirm the final plans generated for the client's approval. These will be sent to the local mayor's office to obtain the permits.
Once we have the permits from the mayor's office we can schedule a date for the installation of the panels.
